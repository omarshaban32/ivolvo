Lab 3: Shell Scripting Basics â€¢ Objective: Create a shell script that would ping every single server in the 172.16.17.x subnet where X IS a number between 0 and 255. If a ping succeeds, statement "Server 172.16.17.x is up and running" will be displayed. Otherwise, if a SI ping fails, statement "Server 172.16.17.x is unreachable" will be displayed.
